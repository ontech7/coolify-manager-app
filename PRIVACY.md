# Privacy Policy for Coolify Manager App

_Last updated: January 31, 2026_

## 1. Overview

Coolify Manager App ("the App") is a companion tool developed by Andrea Losavio to let you manage your self-hosted Coolify server from an Android device. The App connects directly to the Coolify instance that you configure and does not send your data to any third-party service.

## 2. Data We Collect

The App does not collect, process, or transmit personal data to the developer or to any external service. All data handled by the App is limited to:

- Server URL you supply for your Coolify instance
- API token you generate on your Coolify server
- Application and deployment information retrieved from your Coolify instance via its REST API

## 3. How Data Is Stored

The server URL and API token are stored locally on your device using Expo Secure Store (encrypted storage provided by the operating system). They are never uploaded, synced, or shared with the developer.

## 4. How Data Is Used

The App uses the stored API token solely to authenticate requests to your Coolify server. API responses (such as application lists, deployment status, and logs) are displayed within the App session and are not persisted beyond the in-memory state required for the current view.

## 5. Network Communications

All network requests go directly from your device to the Coolify server URL you configure. The App does not proxy these requests through any developer-controlled infrastructure. You are responsible for ensuring that your Coolify instance is reachable via HTTPS to protect your credentials and data in transit.

## 6. Permissions

The App does not request device permissions beyond secure storage access provided by the operating system. No location, contact, camera, microphone, or background data access is required.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The App does not embed advertising SDKs, analytics services, crash reporters, or other third-party data processors.

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for technical administrators of Coolify instances and is not directed to children under 13. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

The developer may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App’s functionality or legal requirements. Updated versions will be published in the App repository. Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
